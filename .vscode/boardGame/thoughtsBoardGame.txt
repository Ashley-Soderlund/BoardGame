Part 2:

 inheritance (class GameEntry: public Student)

Operater Overload:
GameEntry operator <<();
So we are printing out all GameEntry values with their names and other information from Student?
Yes print all information

Compare:
friend function in GameEntry
pass in 2 players (GameEntry objects) with same game and semester
*player1 is better than player2 if both gpa and scores of player2 are higher than that of player1
& vice-versa
*player1 and player2 have similar performance if both gpa and scores match

Sorting:
int i = 1;
    while(i<v.size()){
        int j=i;
        while(j>0 && v[j-i] > v[j]){
            swap(v[j], v[j-1]);
            j -= 1;
        }
        i += 1;
    }

Needs to be done with gpa and name of student, & output




Have only used terminal to connect with GitHub, so I need to figure out what I need to do with source control.





------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does score = current position?

1) ask for numberOfPlayers
2) Initializing players using GameEntry class (3)
3) Initializing gameName using Scores class (3)
4) Use code fragment 3.9 for creating the board
5) While (countPlayersFinished != numberOfPlayers)
    4.1) player1.setScore() = play(player1.getScore())
    4.2) player2.setScore() = play(player2.getScore())
    4.3) player3.setScore() = play(player3.getScore())
    4.4) if(player1.getScore() == n)
        4.41) gameName.add(player1)
        4.42) Call destructor
        4.43) countPlayersFinished++
6) display gameName.output() 


--------------------------------------------

play
    1)random number generation 1-6 (cstdlib)
    2)add parameter value to step1
    3)temp = negativeFunction(sum of step 1 and two)
    4) temp = positiveFunction(score)
    5)return score

*Board:
Create 2D Dymanic Array of random size

int board[x][y];
getRandom()

-using a single pointer
-using an array of pointers


Should these be in 4 files? Two .cpp and Two .hpp?
Game Entry Class
Scores Class- max entries set to 3

DiceRollFunction():
on a player's turn return a value of 1-6

*checkIfWin(Class player)-


prime number = array of prime numbers or function to check if poition is prime
     <= 5

int negativeFunction(int score)-
    checkIfPrime(currentPosition): return result
    if(result == True):
       position = position - 5
       if(position % 7 == 0):
           score - 8 
        else:
            score - 5

    return positve inegter to subtract from current position of player

*int postiveFunction(int score)-
    check if perfectNumber(currentPosition): return variable result
    if(result == True:

        if(position % 10 == 0):
            score= score + 17
        else:
            score = score + 15



    return positive integer that will be added to position


Players:
Should this be a class?
    private:
        int currentRolls;
    public:
        DiceRollFunction();
        negativeFunction();
        postiveFunction();
        checkifwin();


System to run through each player through a turn (Which is rolling a dice)
